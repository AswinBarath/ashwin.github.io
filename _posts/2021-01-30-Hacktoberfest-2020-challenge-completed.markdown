> Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open-source software. It happens every year in October. During this event, everyone can support open-source by contributing changes and then earn limited-edition swag.

The main idea of this event is to promote open source contributions around the world.

Last October I successfully completed the #Hacktoberfest2020 challenge by submitting 4 successful PRs(Pull Requests):

As a Web developer, this was my first open-source contribution.
It was both an amazing and thrilling experience for me.

I worked on [Canvas-Creations](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/Canvas-Creations), a project created by the [ZTM organization](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery).

And here's my contribution:
[Cool-cursor](https://github.com/AswinBarath/Cool-cursor)
The cool cursor is a dynamic javascript project made using the HTML `<canvas>` element.

This is a project which uses a canvas and works dynamically by using the event listener of the mouse-event.
Check out the working demo of the project here: [Cool-cursor](https://aswinbarath.github.io/Cool-cursor/).

So, anyone who is interested in open-source contribution, make sure you bookmark this event in your calendar: A month-long event which takes place in October and you can earn limited-edition swag.

And yesterday, I received my package of the limited-edition swag for 4 successful pull requests:
