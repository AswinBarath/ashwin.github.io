Membership operators are used to testing if a sequence with the specified value is present in the given object.

**[Fact: In python, all data types are implemented as an object.](https://dev.to/aswin2001barath/data-types-in-python-14ol)**

Let's go code through each of them.

## `in` operator
![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/0uo778b7jdco4vskj4xs.png)
Output:
```
True
```

## `not in` operator

Output:
```
True
```

#### Code along and have fun ;)
