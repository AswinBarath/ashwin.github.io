Did you know that loop statements may have an else clause?
Well, it turns out that they can be used!

* `else` clause will be executed when the loop completes through all of the iterations with for loop and when the condition becomes false with while loop.

Example:
![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/kz7855oukd87fm71z04a.png)

Output:
```
Searching...
Searching...
Searching...
Searching...
Searching...
Searching...
Searching...
Searching...
Treasure not found :(
```

* But `else` clause will not be executed when the loop is terminated by a break statement.

Example:
![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/96r445lmure9qsurlwx0.png)

Output:
```
Searching...
Searching...
Searching...
Searching...
Found the treasure
```

#### Code along and have fun.
