Firebase API follows a straightforward approach. 
By invoking these methods will get you access to each Firebase service.

### Syntax to access Firebase Firestore

```
firebase.firestore()
```

### Syntax to access Firebase Authentication

```
firebase.auth()
```

### Syntax to access Firebase Storage

```
firebase.storage()
```

### Firebase hosting commands
Firebase Hosting uses a command-line interface instead of methods on the Firebase object. Run the following commands:

#### Initialize a Firebase project

```
firebase init 
```

#### deploy a Firebase project

```
firebase deploy 
```
