Firestore is an excellent choice these days as almost every app needs persistent data. Following are the benefits of firestore:
- Realtime
- NoSQL
- Security

### Realtime
Realtime means that for every change made in the database, the connected users updates with these changes. This feature saves you a lot of time when you are developing applications. It provides clear logic and reduces your code length.

### NoSQL
Firestore is a NoSQL document database. There has been a surf of popularity for NoSQL databases. A lot of developers find them more comfortable to use.

### Security
Firestore provides a set of security rules with which you can easily create restrictions for who can read, write, update, or delete data from your database.

Firebase storage can scale up to petabytes.

## Authentication

To build an authentication system from scratch is tiresome and can get tricky. Firebase offers a solution to authentication that requires less code, less time, and better security through the following features:
- Email and Password Authentication
- OAuth authentication
    - Using an existing platform to authenticate a user is known as OAuth. Firebase utilizes Google, Facebook, Twitter, Github, and many other providers that you can use to authenticate your users.

Each Firebase service can be used on its own or together with the other services. Hence makes it easy to pick and choose the right services for your specific application.

Firebase offers various services.
So, I encourage you to take the time to explore the other services as well.
