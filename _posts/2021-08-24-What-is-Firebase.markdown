Let us first understand how is a full-stack application built.
A full-stack application consists of a front-end component and a back-end component.
A front-end component is what we see, a user interface(UI).
A back-end component communicates with the UI to send, receive, store and/or delete data.

Firebase is **Back-End as a Service (BaaS)**.
Firebase gives you all the benefits of a back-end without the complexities of creating one up from scratch.

## Benefits of Firebase

### Reduce Development Time
Let's face it. We can get impatient when we want a full-stack application as soon as possible. With Firebase, you can cut down development time.

### Security
Firebase provides built-in security. If you configure it in the right way, your app will be a solid fortress.

### High-Speed Caching
Your app deployed using Firebase hosting gets cached on solid-state drives (SSD) throughout the world. Your app loading time will become extremely fast that also helps with SEO.

### Realtime Data
Cloud Firestore database updates all connected clients in real-time. The ability to get real-time updates makes applications a lot easier to implement.
