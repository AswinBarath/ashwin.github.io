Python is an interpreted, high-level, powerful general-purpose programming language.

You may ask, Python’s a snake right? and Why is this programming language named after it?

Well, you are in the right place to discover it! and I’ll also answer the Why? What? How? Questions on Python programming.

## Why do we need to know about Python?

**People prefer Python over French (What!😮)**
According to a recent survey, in the UK, Python overtook French to be the most popular language taught in primary schools.(OMG!)
6 of 10 parents preferred their children to learn Python over French.

## What is Python?

### Some History and Why the name ‘Python’?

Let’s start a Flashback tale(Trust me it’s interesting😉).

Python is created by a guy named Guido van Rossum.

Guido Van Rossum was looking for a hobby project to keep him occupied in the week around Christmas.

He chose to call it Python, coz Guido himself is a big fan of Monty Python’s Flying Circus ( Popular British comedy troupe).

So rather being in an irrelevant mood he named the project ‘Python’.

Hence the name Python was adopted. Well, this resulted in you reading my Blog(Hahaha!), but here’s a fact (Are you ready to be stunned?)

Python influenced Javascript and 8 other languages to be designed,
-> C, Java, Perl, AWK, HyperTalk, Lua, Scheme and Self.

😮Yes, you read it right!!, Python has influenced all these languages to be either designed or updated after it.

## What do you need to know about Python?

Well, now you may wonder Python is something worthwhile to know isn’t!

👇Here’s Bite-sized info to offer you on basic points on the features of Python programming language. (Apologies for my Handwriting!😅).

## Python Ecosystem

Python is a favourite choice for programming when it comes to Machine Learning, Deep Learning or even Web Development.

The ecosystem grows a lot day by day with libraries and frameworks(some of the most used ones are mentioned in this sketch right down below 👇!).

### Let me list these out with its functionalities:-

Machine Learning/Data Science: Pandas(Data Analysis), NumPy, SciPy (Mathematical and scientific computation), matplotlib (Plotting), Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, PyTorch(Machine Learning/Deep Learning libraries).

Jupyter Notebook: Developer Environment

Web Development: Flask(Micro Web Framework), Django(Multi-level Web Framework).
