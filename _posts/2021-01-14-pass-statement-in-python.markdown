The `pass` statement does nothing.

Wow, that's a bummer!

Hmmm...
Then, why do we need it?

Well, it can be used when *a statement is required syntactically but the program requires no action.*

This is also commonly used for creating empty classes so that we can come back later and code something:

Another place `pass` statement can be used is inside a function:

### Note:
* The body of any statement containing `pass` statements are ignored by the python interpreter, just like it ignores comments.


### Code along and fave fun.
