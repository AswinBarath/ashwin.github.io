Logical operators are used to combining more than two conditional statements.

These operators are very useful for writing logical conditions in control flow statements of a programming language.

Let's code them one by one.

## `and` operator
* and operator return the boolean value `True` only if both statements are true.

Output:
```
True
```


## `or` operator
* or operator returns the boolean value `True` if any statement is true.

Output:
```
True
```


## `not` operator
* not-operator acts as a unary operator which returns the boolean value `True` the statement is true and vice versa.
