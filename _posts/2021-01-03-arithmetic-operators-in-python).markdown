Operators are used to performing operations on any given data stored inside variables.

And **arithmetic operators** makes mathematical operations possible on operands in a program.

I know! I know! This is a basic concept! But let's make it fun!

## Starting with addition and subtraction

Output:
```
Addition 9
Subtraction 8
```

## Now, Multiplication and Division

Output:
```
Multiplication 314.0
Division 2.0
```

## Special arithmetic operators
* *Floor division - `//`*: rounds of the result to the nearest whole number.
* *Modulus - `%`*: produces the remainder of the numbers

Output:
```
Floor Division 3
Modulus 1
```
* Exponentiation - ** : produces the power of given numbers

Output:
```
Exponentiation 0.025517964452291125
Exponentiation 37.78343433288728
```

#### Code along and have fun ;)
