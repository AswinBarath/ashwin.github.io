Identity operators are used to checking whether the objects are the same or not.

**[Fact: In python, all data types are implemented as an object.](https://dev.to/aswin2001barath/data-types-in-python-14ol)**

## `is` operator
![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/pa8a04m12fj8mbfccex5.png)
Output:
```
True
False
True
```

## `is not` operator
![Alt Text](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/mocqh7fi8phb0ojqkaen.png)
Output:
```
True
False
True
```


#### Code along and have fun ;)
